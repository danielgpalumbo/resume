## TODO: 
 * actually make branches and stop pushing straight to main(I know I know)
 * fix my blurry images
 * add a landing page
 * add more content in general
 * design my own svg icons to use instead of the bootstrap ones
 * add a pokernight signup to this site 
 * add an openAPI for fun
 * figure out a more cohesive theme
 * host this site on my own personal domain
